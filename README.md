# Docker in Azure

## Objective
**Goal:** Deploy a Docker container in Azure, integrate with PostgreSQL using Docker Compose, and automate deployment using GitHub CI/CD.

## Key Terms
- **Docker Container:** Lightweight, standalone package containing everything needed to run software.
- **Azure:** Microsoft's cloud computing service for application deployment and management.
- **Docker Compose:** Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **PostgreSQL (Postgres):** Open-source relational database management system.
- **GitHub CI/CD:** Continuous Integration and Deployment methodologies using GitHub Actions.
- **Azure Container Registry:** Azure service for storing and managing container images.

## Prerequisites
Participants should:
1. Understand basic Docker and containerization concepts.
2. Be familiar with PostgreSQL and database management.
3. Know GitHub basics, particularly repositories and version control.
4. Read about Azure services, focusing on Azure Container Registry and App Services.
5. Install Docker and Git on their machines.

## Implementation
1. **Review Existing Container:** Examine the Docker container from the previous session.
2. **Set Up Azure Environment:** Create and configure Azure Container Registry.
3. **Docker Compose Integration:** Write `docker-compose.yml` for the application and PostgreSQL.
4. **GitHub Repository Setup:** Initialize a repository for application code and Docker configurations.
5. **Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions:** Create workflows for testing and deployment.
6. **Deploy on Azure:** Push the Docker container to Azure Container Registry and deploy to Azure services.
7. **Testing and Validation:** Conduct end-to-end tests to validate deployment and database integration.
